# software-tools-review
This repository contains the code used to generate figures for the review of software tools for CRISPR-Cas.

The figures in Box 2 were generated using the Jupyter notebook entitled "box2-pdna.ipynb." We recommend you use nbviewer (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view the notebook. Simply input the github username/repository name (ruth-hanna/software-tools-review) and navigate to the notebook to view the HTML notebook.

The figures in Figure 1 were generated using the Python script entitled "annotate_clinvar_snps.py." The files entitled "summary_df_Fig1_Cas.txt" and "summary_df_Fig1_BE.txt" are the output files of annotate_clinvar_snps.py for the Cas nucleases and base editors, respectively. 

The figures in Figure 2, panels b-e were generated using the code in "guide-comparison.ipynb." The input files are included in Figure2/inputfiles.
